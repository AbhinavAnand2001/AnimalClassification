# Animal Classification of Indian Wild Animals using CNN and YOLO on Jetson Nano
Description
The "Animal Classification of Indian Wild Animals" project is designed to automatically detect and classify wild animals in real-time using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. This project focuses on identifying common wild animals found in India and alerts users to their presence, which can be vital for wildlife monitoring, conservation efforts, and human safety in areas close to wildlife habitats.

The project is deployed on a Jetson Nano, a compact and powerful AI computer, which processes images from a camera in real-time. When a wild animal is detected, the system classifies the animal species and triggers an alert by activating a buzzer. This rapid identification and alert mechanism is crucial for preventing human-wildlife conflicts and enhancing the safety of both animals and people.

Key features of the project include:

Real-Time Animal Detection: Uses YOLO for fast and accurate detection of animals in live camera feeds.
Animal Classification: Employs CNNs to classify detected animals into specific species commonly found in Indian wildlife.
Jetson Nano Deployment: Optimized for real-time processing on the Jetson Nano platform.
Alert System: Sends an immediate alert to a buzzer upon detection of an animal.

Data Overview
The dataset used in this project consists of images of various Indian wild animals, such as tigers, elephants, leopards, deer, and more. The images are labeled with the species name, which is used for training the classification model.

Implementation
Data Collection and Preprocessing
Image Collection: Images of different Indian wild animals are collected from various sources.
Data Augmentation: Techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping are applied to enhance the dataset and improve model generalization.
Normalization: Image pixel values are normalized to improve model training efficiency.
CNN Model for Classification
Architecture: A CNN is used for feature extraction and classification. The model is trained to classify the detected animals into specific species.
Training: The CNN is trained on the preprocessed dataset using techniques like early stopping and learning rate scheduling.
YOLO for Object Detection
YOLO Model: YOLOv4 or YOLOv5 is used for real-time object detection. It is fine-tuned on the dataset to detect specific animals.
Integration with CNN: Detected animals are passed to the CNN for species classification.
Real-Time Deployment on Jetson Nano
Camera Feed Processing: The Jetson Nano processes the live camera feed to detect and classify animals in real-time.
Alert System: A buzzer connected to the Jetson Nano is triggered when a wild animal is detected.
Results and Analysis
Detection Accuracy: The YOLO model demonstrates high accuracy in detecting animals in various environmental conditions.
Classification Performance: The CNN model accurately classifies detected animals into their respective species.
Real-Time Performance: The system runs efficiently on the Jetson Nano, providing real-time detection and alerts with minimal latency.
Conclusion
The "Animal Classification of Indian Wild Animals" project successfully demonstrates the use of advanced AI techniques for wildlife monitoring and safety. By integrating CNN and YOLO models on a Jetson Nano platform, this system provides a real-time solution for detecting and classifying wild animals, thereby aiding in wildlife conservation and preventing human-animal conflicts.
